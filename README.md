# zr-mission-bot
Zombies, Run! Mission Generator Bot

## Usage
* Obtain a set of Flickr API keys and make a local configuration file (config.py) using [config.py.example](https://github.com/scotchfield/zr-mission-bot/blob/master/config.py.example)
* Download the [San Francisco fonts](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) and copy SFDisplay-Regular.otf and SFText-RegularItalic.otf into the repository root
* `python bot.py`
* Pick up a first aid kit and a CDC box!

## Note
This bot is not an official product of Six to Start, and these are not real missions. The photos come from Flickr, and the objects list comes from [Darius Kazemi's Corpora Repo](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora) which is great and wonderful *and* awesome.
